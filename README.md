## 📜 Project Description

A delightfully useless “stress relief” app for corporate employees that pretends to help, but really just makes things worse — hilariously. Features include sarcastic bubble popping, a judging typer, a duck-quacking chaotic calendar, and a roast-song generator.

---

## 🚨 The Problem (that doesn’t exist)

Corporate employees are just *too productive*. They need distractions that look like productivity but are actually chaos in disguise.

---

## 💡 The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We built a “relief” portal that:

* Pops fake bubble wrap but with duck and frog noises
* Roasts users for how they type and ruins their words
* Schedules fake events in a duck-themed calendar that mocks deadlines
* Writes embarrassing songs 

You're welcome, overachievers.
